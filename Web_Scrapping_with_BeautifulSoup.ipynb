If randomness sources are provided by the operating system, they are used instead of the system time (see the os.urandom() function for details on availability). If a is an int, it is used directly. With version 2 (the default), a str, bytes, or bytearray object gets converted to an int and all of its bits are used. With version 1 (provided for reproducing random sequences from older versions of Python), the algorithm for str and bytes generates a narrower range of seeds.  Changed in version 3.2: Moved to the version 2 scheme which uses all of the bits in a string seed.

The positional argument pattern matches that of range().  Keyword arguments should not be used because the function may use them in unexpected ways.  Changed in version 3.2: randrange() is more sophisticated about producing equally distributed values.  Formerly it used a style like int(random()*n) which could produce slightly uneven distributions.   Deprecated since version 3.10: The automatic conversion of non-integer types to equivalent integers is deprecated.  Currently randrange(10.0) is losslessly converted to randrange(10).  In the future, this will raise a TypeError.   Deprecated since version 3.10: The exception raised for non-integral values such as randrange(10.5) or randrange('10') will be changed from ValueError to TypeError.  \", 'Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.

', 'Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq. If seq is empty, raises IndexError. ', 'Return a k sized list of elements chosen from the population with replacement. If the population is empty, raises IndexError. If a weights sequence is specified, selections are made according to the relative weights.  Alternatively, if a cum_weights sequence is given, the selections are made according to the cumulative weights (perhaps computed using itertools.accumulate()).  For example, the relative weights [10, 5, 30, 5] are equivalent to the cumulative weights [10, 15, 45, 50].  Internally, the relative weights are converted to cumulative weights before making selections, so supplying the cumulative weights saves work. If neither weights nor cum_weights are specified, selections are made with equal probability.  If a weights sequence is supplied, it must be the same length as the population sequence.  It is a TypeError to specify both weights and cum_weights. The weights or cum_weights can use any numeric type that interoperates with the float values returned by random() (that includes integers, floats, and fractions but excludes decimals).  Weights are assumed to be non-negative and finite.  A ValueError is raised if all weights are zero. For a given seed, the choices() function with equal weighting typically produces a different sequence than repeated calls to choice().  The algorithm used by choices() uses floating point arithmetic for internal consistency and speed.  The algorithm used by choice() defaults to integer arithmetic with repeated selections to avoid small biases from round-off error.  New in version 3.6.   Changed in version 3.9: Raises a ValueError if all weights are zero.  ', 'Shuffle the sequence x in place. To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list, use sample(x, k=len(x)) instead. Note that even for small len(x), the total number of permutations of x can quickly grow larger than the period of most random number generators. This implies that most permutations of a long sequence can never be generated.  For example, a sequence of length 2080 is the largest that can fit within the period of the Mersenne Twister random number generator.

Used for random sampling without replacement. Returns a new list containing elements from the population while leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices). Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible selection in the sample. Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional keyword-only counts parameter.  For example, sample(['red', 'blue'], counts=[4, 2], k=5) is equivalent to sample(['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'blue', 'blue'], k=5). To choose a sample from a range of integers, use a range() object as an argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a large population:  sample(range(10000000), k=60). If the sample size is larger than the population size, a ValueError is raised.  Changed in version 3.9: Added the counts parameter.   Changed in version 3.11: The population must be a sequence.
